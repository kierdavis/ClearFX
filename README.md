ClearFX is a (very) lightweight plugin to allow administrators to clear players' potion effects. It is useful to force players using invisibility potions to become visible, or to remove speed/strength effects being used to cheat in PvP arenas.

# Commands

* `/clearfx` - Clears your own effects
* `/clearfx <player>` - Clears another player's effects

# Permissions

* `clearfx.clear` - Gives access to the /clearfx command
* `clearfx.clear.self` - Gives access to clear own effects
* `clearfx.clear.others` - Gives access to clear other players' effects

Note that both `clearfx.clear` and `clearfx.clear.self` are needed to be able to clear your own effects; likewise, `clearfx.clear` and `clearfx.clear.others` are needed to clear others' effects.

# Configuration

No configuration is needed for this plugin.
